# **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction**
## Problem Description
### Public rental bike sharing system has been gaining popularity in the recent times.Currently,this system has been introduced in many major cities for enhancement of mobility comfort.It is also a great step towards environmental sustainability and social welfare.
### In order to run this system successfully,it is important to ensure that the rental bikes are available and accessible to the public at the right time,since this reduces the waiting time.Providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes could become a serious challenge,eventually.Forecasting the number of bikes required at each hour can greatly help in ensuring that there's a stable supply of rental bikes.
### Our objective here,is to predict the Count of Rental bikes required on an hourly basis and to also identify the features which influences the hourly demand for Rental bikes.

> * Predicting the number of bikes rented per hour in Seoul, South Korea.
> * Performed EDA on the dataset and found features 'Hour', 'Temp.' and 'Season' to be most important. Also performed Feature Engineering to extract some features.
> * Used many regression algorithms for predicting the number of bikes like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost etc.
> * Also performed hyperparameter tuning on models to improve them further.
> * Best performing models after tuning, R2-score of Random Forest: 92.25%, XGBoost: 94.53%, CatBoost: 94.46%.
